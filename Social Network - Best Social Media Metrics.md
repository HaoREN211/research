Social media is evolving at an incredible pace. Most of us have no idea how to participate optimally in this unique channel – we are doing TV on Twitter (breaks my heart). The impact on the data side of the ecosystem is that massive amounts of data is being generated and much of what goes for measurement in "social media tools" is profoundly sub optimal (I'm being polite). We have IT-minded people engaging in massive data puking (one report with 30 metrics anyone?) and Marketing-minded people who are using lousy measures of success ("I got 158,632 Fans! Hurray!").

Isn't that revolutionary? Use data to incentivise our companies to do the right thing by measuring what matters, what makes this channel so unique.

No more embarrassing your brand on Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, YouTube. And we build out a loyal cadre of followers / friends / subscribers to boot!

Not the number of ___Friends___ / ___Followers___ / ___Subscribers___. Not the number of posts / tweets. Not the ridiculous Followers to Following ratio. Not the… well there are so many horrible ones to choose from.

## 1. Conversation Rate.
We know little about who is on the other end of the TV set and the medium places limits to what we can do. So to make our marketing more efficient we shout more loudly, more frequently!

We don't have to do that. We can get a very good sense for who is following / friending / subscribing to us. We can measure if what we are saying connects to them (in near real time!). And unlike all others, this channel has the word social in it! Social as in talk and listen and discuss.
```
Conversation Rate = # of Audience Comments (or Replies) Per Post
```
One beautiful thing… you can measure this on every social channel on the planet. Blog. Twitter. Facebook. Google Plus. YouTube.
### What to do with it?
___A high conversation rate requires a deeper understanding of who your audience is, what your brand attributes are, what you are good at, what value you can add to your followers and the ecosystem you participate in.___

It forces you to do the right thing right away. And it is a lot of work.

So aim for a higher Conversation Rate. Build your own watering hole in the digital universe. Have meaningful conversations with your audience. That's Marketing money just can't buy.

You can always be provocative, say silly things and get a high Conversation Rate. Pick Sarah Palin for your topic. :) But that would not be accretive for your brand equity, would it?

Remember we do not measure to manipulate the metrics, we measure to know if we are adding business value.
### How to measure it?
Individually this is not that hard to measure. But across channels there does not seem to be an option.

## 2. Amplification Rate.
Every channel has inherent limitations, often exhibited by the number of ads you can buy. On Google (paid search), on Facebook (display ads), on Radio (audio ads), and all other channels you can think of.

But social media has a profound advantage you can tap into.

___Not only do you have a network, but every node in your network has a network of its own! If you post something "incredible, relevant, of value" to your audience then they can allow you to break free of the limitations of your network and spread your word around to a more massive audience!___

Take Avinash Kaushik as an example. He has, as of today, 57k followers on Twitter and around 12k on Google Plus. That's the limit. Even if every single person who follows him reads every single thing he writes, he can at most reach 57k people on Twitter.

But the size of his second level network (the unique people who follow the people who follow him) is 6.3 mil. His real "reach" it turns out is not 57k, it is 6.3 mil!

So measure Amplification, the rate at which your followers take your content and share it through their network.

```
On Twitter:
    Amplification = # of Retweets Per Tweet
On Facebook, Google Plus:
    Amplification = # of Shares Per Post
On a blog, YouTube:
    Amplification = # of Share Clicks Per Post (or Video)
```
### What to do with it?
As you post and tweet and you rock and you roll… measure what pieces of content (type) cause amplification (allow your social contributions to spread to your 2nd, or even 3rd, level network). Understand times and geo locations and topics and things.

Then do more of the type that increase amplification. You'll get more sharing and spreading of your content. But this is very, very important: You'll be giving your audience content they consider to be of such incredible value that they want to share it (and hence you'll know what your audience wants / loves).

Oh, oh, oh and…. over time your 2nd level network becomes your 1st level network… because they discover that you rock!

Marketing, relationships and a reach that money, honestly, can't buy.

### How to measure it?
I don't quite know how to do it easily across all the channels. Individually you can, see image above, pull out Excel and make magic!

## 3. Applause Rate.
One powerful, more immediate way, to understand them is to measure Applause.

```
One Twitter:
    Applause Rate = # of Favorite Clicks Per Post
On Facebook:
    Applause Rate = # of Likes Per Post
On Google Plus:
    Applause Rate = # of +1s Per Post
On a Blog, YouTube:
    Applause Rate = # of +1s and Likes Per Post (or video)
```

### What to do with it?
Simple… you want to know what the audience likes (to use the Facebook terminology) and what they don't. ___You get a much deeper understanding of what your audience likes so much that it will +1 your content (or contribution) and allow for that to be then shown to others in their social graph.___

And consider this…

If you +1 this blog post, you'll not help me understand its relative quality, but when someone in our extended social graph does a search on Google for Social Media Metrics your endorsement of this content will show up in the search results. That's reassuring to your social graph, and it is great for me because your endorsement makes this post stand out over others and I get a relevant visitor/customer.

Sweet, right? Your selfless social media contribution comes back to assist you in driving valuable business outcomes.

That's why you measure Applause. It matters in ways you can't imagine!
### How to measure it?
Individually the numbers are available in most tools. Easy to find in Google+ (see example in the end). For Facebook the number is included in Facebook Insights, though it is not available as easily in a simple way (at least not as expansively as outlined above). For Twitter, sadly I could not find it anywhere (inside Twitter or other tools).
## 4. Economic Value.
It is foolish to believe that just Conversation Rate, Amplification Rate, Applause Rate will get you the eternal love and gratification (and perhaps budget!) of your company's leadership. Yes they care a little bit about this "social media thing." But if you want their adoration (and let me repeat: budget!) ___you are going to have to quantify the economic value created via social media.___

You don't participate in social media to only drive business outcomes. I cannot stress that enough. If that is your primary objective you are going to suck at it (and the above metrics will reflect very efficiently how much you suck).

A small percent of the people in your company / brand's social graph will come to your main digital outpost (usually your company website) and choose to do business with you. Some of them will buy something, others will sign up for your email marketing list, others still will order a catalog or write reviews for products on your site or sign up as an affiliate or create wish lists or marriage registries or phone your call center to order something or… stay with me…. buy your products or services in your supermarket / store / real world thing.

And you know what all of those things are? [Macro and Micro Conversions](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/excellent-analytics-tip-13-measure-macro-and-micro-conversions/)!

And you know what you can do with macro and micro conversions? You can measure [Economic Value](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/web-analytics-tips-identify-website-goal-values/)!

On all social media channels:
```
Economic Value = Sum of Short and Long Term Revenue and Cost Savings
```
Social media participation, done right, adds value to the company's bottom-line. Some of it can't be computed. That is okay. But some of it can be and it is your job, nay duty (!), to quantify that.

It is not very hard to do. Read the two posts immediately above. They share very specific guidance for businesses of different types (B2B, B2C, A2K) about how to identify the macro and micro conversions and then compute economic value.
